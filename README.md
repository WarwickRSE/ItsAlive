# ItsAlive
This repo contains code from Warwick RSE live coding demonstrations - so you can see exactly the code we wrote every time. This means there may be *bugs* and there will likely be some *poor design elements*, because we are not perfect!

For well written example codes, see the examples repository for the workshop you attended.
