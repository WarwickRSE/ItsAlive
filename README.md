# ItsAlive
This repo contains code from Warwick RSE live coding demonstrations - so you can see exactly the code we wrote every time. This means there may be *bugs* and there will likely be some *poor design elements*, because we are not perfect!
There are also very few comments! Real code should have plenty of comments for the benefit of any future reader.


For well written example codes, see the examples repository for the workshop you attended.
